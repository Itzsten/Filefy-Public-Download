# Filefy Download
Finally, my new trojan called Filefy is now released publicly- for the first time ever! Feel free to test it on a virtual machine or record a video about it, but credit would be appreciated (as a relatively small creator). This is the version that's recoded in C, for an attempt to exclude the attempts of decompilation and removal of the warning. This is only for demostrational and educational purposes only, I, (itzsten) am not responsible for anything, whatsoever that you do with this malicious program. Don't use it for malicious purposes or you'll have a bad time at jail (not kidding).

# Information about the virus in general
So now, you maybe want to make a YouTube video about it, or just generally want to know what the malware is about. Well, the malware itself took 28 full hours to code. I don't really want to spoil too much but the first payload contains a 3D cube rotating around the screen. (Made in pure GDI). The second payload gives the screen a radial rotation and JPG compression. The third payload just really takes parts of the screen and puts them slightly higher then where they was before (simply explained). The fourth payload, draws colorized circles randomly on your screen, and does a tunnel sharpening. The fifth payload, rotates the screen 3-Dimensionally.

It also uses the system method to cause a bluescreen. The malware was firstly coded in Python, but then only given out to a smaller amount of creators (such as JhoPro(AirTic), Haxhom(Luka master) etc.). This version is the one that is recoded in C, and this is as said to minimize the risks of decompilation and warning removed. I've probably never had a public malware before. I still am nervous, as I'm typing this out right here and now. There's absolutely no way that I, can trust random people from the internet being able to handle a malicious program, I thought. Now I've changed my mind, I'm still a bit nervous about it, but I feel like it'll be worth it in the end.
